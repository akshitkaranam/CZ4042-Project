# CZ4042 Speech Emotion Recognition

There are 2 python notebooks:

1. CZ4042_EDA contains Exploratory Data Analysis
2. CZ4042 Model contains Data Pre-Processing, Model Exploration, Hyperparameter Tuning, Final Model and Real Time Analysis

Each notebook is seperated into the subsections. It is better to view it in Google Colab, as it allows a nicer formatting, where some sub-sections can be hidden.
